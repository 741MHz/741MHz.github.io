    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to computers, both programming and science have a &ldquo;longest match&rdquo; principe also known as &ldquo;maximal munch&rdquo;. This principle states that when creating some construct, as much of the available input as possible should be consumed. Which in turn leads to the fact that lexical syntax of many programming languages requires that tokens be built from the maximum possible number of characters from the input stream.</p>

<p>As a result of this, C++ has been suffering a minor, but persisting, annoying, and somewhat embarrassing problem that required programmers to avoid having two consecutive right angle brackets when writing templates. For example, the following code has been incorrect in C++ for decades:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; matrix;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is because the longest token in this expression is <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, which is a token for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift">right logical shift</a>, and it has nothing to do with templates. So the compiler would give an error. For example:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>g++ ./matrix.cc</h1>

<p>./matrix.cc:21:32: error: a space is required between consecutive right angle brackets (use &lsquo;> >&rsquo;)</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; matrix;
                           ^~
                           &gt; &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And the programmers had to put a space between <code>&gt;</code> to fix it, like this: <code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; matrix;</code></p>

<p>This is not the only example of maximal munch drawbacks. Another notable case is unintended beginning of multi-line comment as in this program:</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>include &lt;stdio.h></h1>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>int a;
int *z;
int x;
int y;

a = 2;
z = &amp;a;
y = 10;
x = y/*z;

printf("%d\n", x);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>For both humans and even a syntax highlighter it is clear that the intention of <code>x = y/*z</code> statement is to assigne <code>x</code> a result of dividing <code>y</code> by the value obtained through dereferencing <code>z</code> pointer. Yet <code>/*</code> is the longest match which corresponds to the beginning of the multiline comment, so the compiler would most likely fail:</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>g++ ./example.cc
./example.cc:25:10: error: unterminated /* comment</p>

<pre><code>x = y/*z;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>For the good of all C++ developers, Daveed Vandevoorde from Edison Design Group has proposed three possible ways to fix C++ grammar to eliminate the problem of two consecutive right angle brackets in templates. One of them was chosen over other two and starting with C++11, programmers can now use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in templates like this &ndash;  <code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>It is important that this change also breaks backwards compatibility which could affect some programs. Consider the following program:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>template<int I> struct X {</p>

<pre><code>static int const c = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>template&lt;> struct X<0> {</p>

<pre><code>typedef int c;
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>template<typename T> struct Y {</p>

<pre><code>static int const c = 3;
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>static int const c = 4;</p>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; (Y&lt;X&lt;1&gt; &gt;::c &gt;::c&gt;::c) &lt;&lt; '\n';
std::cout &lt;&lt; (Y&lt;X&lt; 1&gt;&gt;::c &gt;::c&gt;::c) &lt;&lt; '\n';
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>It is valid in both old and new C++. However, it would produce different results.</p>

<p>This is because in the old C++ <code>&gt;&gt;</code> was treated as the right shift operator that shifted 1 by the value of global <code>c</code> as part of <code>1&gt;&gt;::c</code> expression. But with a new grammar introduced in C++ this is no longer the case and so the same program would print <code>0</code> and <code>3</code> in pre-C++11, and two zeroes in C++11.</p>

<p>Some compiler developers, when started working on implementing new C++ standard, have put a special feature their compilers that would warn users about such cases. For example, clang compiler would issue a warning in case it runs into this code:</p>

<p>```
$ clang++ ./right_angle_brackets.cc &amp;&amp; ./test
./right_angle_brackets.cc:19:25: warning: use of right-shift operator (&lsquo;>>&rsquo;) in template argument will require</p>

<pre><code>  parentheses in C++11 [-Wc++11-compat]
std::cout &lt;&lt; (Y&lt;X&lt; 1&gt;&gt;::c &gt;::c&gt;::c) &lt;&lt; '\n';
                    ^
                   (     )
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Hopefully, not many developers have intentionally used logical shifts as part of template parameters, and the amount of those cases are far less from those when an annoying extra space was required for no good reason.</p>

<p>As for the problem with comments &ndash; it still exists in both C and C++. But how much of a problem is it, really?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Assertions is one of they key features of almost every programming language that help programmers verify their assumptions made when writing the code.
In C, assertion mechanism is provided by <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/assert.3.html">assert()</a> preprocessor macro defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assert.h">assert.h</a> header file. C++ programs can also use it by including &ldquo;<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cassert">cassert</a>&rdquo; header file. As an added benefit, assertions also serve as documentation of the internal details of the program enhancing the code maintainability. Here is a simple C++11 example:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<h1>include <cassert></h1>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; argc; ++i) {
    assert(argv[i] != nullptr);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; argv[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
GNU C library also provides a convenient function to check for error numbers called &ldquo;<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/assert_perror.3.html">assert_perror()</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There are at least 71 more programming language that provide assertion mechanism. You can check them out along with examples at <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Assertions">http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Assertions</a></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The <code>assert()</code> macro in both C and C++ would only check for errors at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase">execution time</a>) when the program is actually running. By definition that implies that:</p>

<ul>
<li>It adds some overhead to the program execution (time, size or both).</li>
<li>The assertion may not be exercised leaving a program undetected for a while (in the worse case, the program may pass a testing stage only to be discover by the end user later).</li>
</ul>


<p>The above two points sound like are necessary evil. But what if we could get rid of those tradeoffs?</p>

<p>There are cases when there is enough information during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time">compile-time</a> to detect a possible error. For example, macro definitions and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tby3xex3(v=vs.110">constant expressions</a>.aspx) are things that do not exist in compile-time.</p>

<p>If only there was a way to check constant expressions in compile-time it would have been always preferred over runtime checking.</p>

<p>Luckily, programmers have figured out a few different ways to do this.</p>

<h2>Workarounds</h2>

<h3>Preprocessor Assertions</h3>

<p>Both C and C++ preprocessors have <code>#error</code> directive that can be used to abort compilation with an error. It can be used to perform compile-time assertions.</p>

<p>For example, consider a simple C program that reads data from into a buffer whose size is specified using a standard <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Controlling-Buffering.html"><code>BUFSIZ</code> macro</a> and the programmer wants to make sure that buffer is at least 1024 bytes large. The code using assertions might look like this:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <cstdio></h1>

<h1>include <cassert></h1>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>// Allocate buffer on stack:
char mybuffer[BUFSIZ];

// Make sure we have at least 1024 bytes:
assert(sizeof(mybuffer) &gt;= 1024);

// Read data into "mybuffer"...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Given that <code>BUFSIZ</code> is a macro, a better solution would be to use preprocessor and its <code>#error</code> directive to check for this at compile-time instead:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <cstdio></h1>

<h1>if BUFSIZ &lt; 1024</h1>

<h1>error Buffer size is too small</h1>

<h1>endif</h1>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>// Allocate buffer on stack:
char mybuffer[BUFSIZ];

// Read data into "mybuffer"...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>When the buffer size defined by <code>BUFSIZ</code> is large enough, the program would compile as normal. But when it isn&rsquo;t, the compile would refuse to compile the program spitting out an error that might look like this:</p>

<p><code>
$ g++ -Wall -pedantic ./assert_example.cc
./assert_example.cc:4:3: error: Buffer size is too small
</code></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this mechanism can be used with binary operands only. In other words, something like this would not work by definition:</p>

<p>```c
char mybuffer[BUFSIZ];</p>

<h1>if sizeof(mybuffer) &lt; 1024</h1>

<h1>error Buffer size is too small</h1>

<h1>endif</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is because preprocessor knows nothing about <code>sizeof</code> operator and cannot use the result of this expression to compare it against 1024.</p>

<p>Of course, being limited to macros usage only is a big problem. And so people accepted the challenge and came up with another way to overcome this limitation&hellip;</p>

<h3>Negative Buffer Size</h3>

<p>C and C++ developers have been relying on the fact that it is impossible to have a buffer of negative size in order to implement compile time assertions. The mechanism is very simple &ndash; evaluate a constant expression and yield <code>1</code> if it evaluates as <code>true</code>, or <code>-1</code> otherwise, and use the result as size of the buffer. For example, let&rsquo;s say we want to make sure that size of the integer is exactly 4 bytes, we could write code like this:</p>

<p><code>c
typedef char assert_int_size[sizeof(int) == 4 ? 1 : -1];
</code></p>

<p>This approach, however, has its own limitations.</p>

<p>In C, it can be used in both function and non-function scopes, but cannot be used inside structs and unions.</p>

<p>Unlike C, C++ allows to have typedef statements, but there is another problem &ndash; if the static assertion is not dependent upon one or more template parameters, then the compiler is permitted to evaluate the static assertion at the point it is first seen, irrespective of whether the template is ever instantiated. In other words &ndash; it is hard to use with templates as programmers should always remember to use a template type in a condition.</p>

<h2>Core Language Support</h2>

<p>Over the years people have been working around issues associated with different workarounds to implement static assertions and realized that there is no way to implement them without a proper core language support.</p>

<h3>C++</h3>

<p>In 2004, Robert Klarer, Dr. John Maddock, Beman Dawes and Howard Hinnant wrote a proposal for adding a static assertion mechanism to the Core Language, known as <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1720.html">N1720</a>.</p>

<p>The proposal was accepted into the C++11 language specification and is implemented by the majority of C++ compilers today as &ldquo;<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert">static_assert()</a>&rdquo; keyword/function.</p>

<p>It comes with no strings attached and accepts two parameters &ndash; a compile-time expressions that is evaluates to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> and a message. If the expression evaluates to <code>false</code>, the compilation is aborted and specified message is shown as an error message. <code>static_assert()</code> can be used in any scope, including templates. For example:</p>

<p>```c++ Static Assert Example</p>

<h1>include <cstdio></h1>

<p>static_assert(BUFSIZ >= 1024, &ldquo;Buffer size is too small&rdquo;);</p>

<p>template <typename T>
struct Foo {</p>

<pre><code>static_assert(sizeof(int) == 4, "Int size is not 4 bytes");
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>// Allocate buffer on stack:
char mybuffer[BUFSIZ];
static_assert(sizeof(mybuffer) &gt;= 1024, "Buffer size is too small");

// Read data into "mybuffer"...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p>In C, static assertions are introduced as part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision">ISO/IEC 9899:2011 standard</a>), informally known as C11. The mechanism is exactly the same as in C++, but the function name is <code>_Static_assert()</code>. For example:</p>

<p>```c C11 Static Assert Example</p>

<h1>include &lt;stdio.h></h1>

<p>_Static_assert(BUFSIZ >= 1024, &ldquo;Buffer size is too small&rdquo;);</p>

<p>struct Foo {</p>

<pre><code>char data[BUFSIZ];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>union Bar {</p>

<pre><code>int x;
char y[4];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>_Static_assert(sizeof(union Bar) == 4, &ldquo;Size of int is not 4 bytes&rdquo;);</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>// Allocate buffer on stack:
char mybuffer[BUFSIZ];
_Static_assert(sizeof(mybuffer) &gt;= 1024, "Buffer size is too small");

// Read data into "mybuffer"...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>It still cannot be used inside structs and unions, though.</p>

<h3>Note on error messages</h3>

<p>There is but one thing about <code>static_assert()</code> that can be pretty annoying &ndash; having to specify an error message even if it is an empty string. Of course, providing good error messages is the way to go. But there are a lot of cases when a condition used in assertion just does not need any extra words.</p>

<p>The first solution that immediately comes to mind is to use the macro like this:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>define STATIC_ASSERT(Expr) static_assert((Expr), #Expr)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note, however, that it won&rsquo;t work well with expressions that contain a comma, like this:</p>

<p><code>c++
STATIC_ASSERT(!std::is_same&lt;T, int&gt;::value);
</code></p>

<p>Of course, programmers can enclose an expression in extra pair of <code>()</code>, but there is a better to do this, using <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html">variadic macros</a>. Here is a complete example:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include &lt;type_traits></h1>

<h1>define STATIC_ASSERT_IMPL(Expr) static_assert((Expr), #Expr)</h1>

<h1>define STATIC_ASSERT(&hellip;) STATIC_ASSERT_IMPL((<strong>VA_ARGS</strong>))</h1>

<p>template <typename T>
struct Foo final {</p>

<pre><code>STATIC_ASSERT(!std::is_same&lt;T, int&gt;::value);
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(int) == 4);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once in a while I like to learn a new technology, a programming language or a trick to entertain myself and, hopefully, keep the mind open. To shift the perception on programming languages a little, I’ve decided to code some Ruby. The mind shift attempt was not successful this time. The language itself didn’t really impress me a lot — it is nice, well designed, has quite a community and a lot of stuff is built around it. But that’s about all there is in it for me. Almost. One of the books about Ruby that I stumbled upon is too damn good. It is the most entertaining and interesting read about programming language that I had in quite some time. It is called “<a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/">Why’s (poignant) Guide to Ruby</a>” and is freely available online under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike license</a>. Here is an excerpt from a beautiful introduction to Ruby on Chapter 3:</p>

<blockquote><p>My conscience won’t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language is designed to accommodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.
But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!
We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak. It is the language of our thoughts.
Read the following aloud to yourself:
5.times { print &ldquo;Odelay!&rdquo; }
In English sentences, punctuation (such as periods, exclamations, parentheses) are silent. Punctuation adds meaning to words, helps give cues as to what the author intended by a sentence. So let’s read the above as: Five times print “Odelay!”</p></blockquote>

<p>There were more examples that, if you read them aloud to yourself, totally make sense to any person:</p>

<p><code>ruby Exit unless the word restaurant includes the word aura:
exit unless "restaurant".include? "aura"
</code></p>

<p><code>ruby With the words ‘toast’, ‘cheese’, and ‘wine’: take each food and print it capitalized:
['toast', 'cheese', 'wine'].each { |food| print food.capitalize  }
</code></p>

<p>This is not to mention beautiful Cartoon Foxes:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/images/the.foxes-3.png">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/images/the.foxes-3.png</a>"></p>

<p>For a moment I thought it was pretty cool. But then I got back to earth. You see, programming in a human language is not fun at all and we all know it. There is a good non-programming life analogy to programming in a human language. It is called “The Law”. If you don’t believe me, go read your country’s tax, labor, criminal or any other law. You could read it as much as you want but chances are that you would either not understand it at all or misinterpret it unless you have a degree from a good law school. And those laws are written in proper English that you can read aloud to yourself. The point is that when it comes to precisely describing what should happen under what circumstances, there will be a domain specific language for it, and you will have to either master it yourself or hire a professional. The language itself doesn’t make things simpler and I would probably get around the law much better if it was written in a formal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing-complete</a> language. And after all, I don’t really think like Ruby. Perhaps I’ve been doing low-level programming for too long now, I don’t know. It is definitely not the language of my thoughts. Not even close.</p>

<p>At any rate, Ruby is still a programming language that leaves a good impression as simple, fun and powerful tool that gets a lot of things done. I really enjoyed it during my crash course and thought it would be cool to write a C++ program in a way that you could read it aloud to your friends who are not programmers and have them understand what it does. Here is what I came up with for those first three Ruby examples:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include &ldquo;ruby.hh&rdquo;</h1>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>// 5.times { print "Odelay!" }
5_times ^ print("Odelay!");

// exit unless "restaurant".include? "aura"
exit_unless ^ "restaurant"_includes("aura");

// ['toast', 'cheese', 'wine'].each { |food| print food.capitalize  }
each({ "toast", "cheese", "wine" }) ^ (print | capitalized);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And as it often happens, C++ did not come with batteries included this time, so I had to come up with a little mess consisting of lambdas, function objects, user-defined literals and initializer lists in order for this mambo-jumbo to work. Most of those are part of C++11 and without them it would have been a lot worse. Here is my terrible code turning C++ into a crazy Ruby-like thing:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>define RUBY_HH</h1>

              c = std::toupper(c);
      case none:
          break;
    }

<pre><code>const char *haystack;
explicit StringIncludesCheck(const char *haystack)
    : haystack(haystack) { }

    return std::strstr(haystack, needle) != nullptr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Luckily, this kind of stuff is rarely needed in the real world C++ programming. Most folks simply code up a few classes, throw a few virtual functions on top and get the job done. But there are some good cases when such a mind-blowing complexity comes handy. <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/xpressive.html">Xpressive</a> is an excellent examples — it is a template regular-expression library that pretty much builds regular expressions in compile-time. Just check this beautiful usage example:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<h1>include &lt;boost/xpressive/xpressive.hpp></h1>

<p>using namespace boost::xpressive;</p>

<p>int main()
{</p>

<pre><code>char const *str = "I was born on 5/30/1973 at 7am.";

// define some custom mark_tags with names more meaningful than s1, s2, etc.
mark_tag day(1), month(2), year(3), delim(4);

// this regex finds a date
cregex date = (month= repeat&lt;1,2&gt;(_d))           // find the month ...
           &gt;&gt; (delim= (set= '/','-'))            // followed by a delimiter ...
           &gt;&gt; (day=   repeat&lt;1,2&gt;(_d)) &gt;&gt; delim  // and a day followed by the same delimiter ...
           &gt;&gt; (year=  repeat&lt;1,2&gt;(_d &gt;&gt; _d));    // and the year.

cmatch what;

if( regex_search( str, what, date ) )
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; what[0]     &lt;&lt; '\n'; // whole match
    std::cout &lt;&lt; what[day]   &lt;&lt; '\n'; // the day
    std::cout &lt;&lt; what[month] &lt;&lt; '\n'; // the month
    std::cout &lt;&lt; what[year]  &lt;&lt; '\n'; // the year
    std::cout &lt;&lt; what[delim] &lt;&lt; '\n'; // the delimiter
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Either way, I don’t think I can make a good Ruby programmer because I tend to write my C++ as if it was C with code-generation built into the compiler and stick to dataflow programming model rather than object-oriented one. And I love it. As my buddy often say, «Cobol programmer could write a Cobol program in pretty much any programming language.»</p>

    <link href="http://741MHz.com/cpp-like-python/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://741MHz.com/cpp-like-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I ran into a somewhat classy piece of code that was analyzing user’s answer to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes%E2%80%93no_question">Yes or No question</a>. The idea was to compare input to various possible answers disregarding the case. The code looked something like this:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <string></h1>

<h1>include &lt;strings.h></h1>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>static bool positive(const char *s)
{</p>

<pre><code>return (strcasecmp(s, "Y") == 0 ||
        strcasecmp(s, "Yes") == 0 ||
        strcasecmp(s, "OK") == 0 ||
        strcasecmp(s, "True") == 0 ||
        strcasecmp(s, "Sure") == 0 ||
        strcasecmp(s, "Of Course") == 0 ||
        strcasecmp(s, "Why not?") == 0);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>int main()
{</p>

<pre><code>std::string s;

for (;;) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Could you please give me $100? " &lt;&lt; std::flush;
    std::getline(std::cin, s);
    if (positive(s.c_str())) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Thank you!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        break;
    } else {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "We don't take «No» for an answer. Did you mean «Yes»?"
                  &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>What I wanted was to extend that funky <code>positive()</code> function to add more possibilities and it made me sad a little. Since I am writing Python scripts once in a while, I remembered about Python’s “in” statement. If I were to write this in Python, I’d do something like this:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/env python</h1>

<h1>&ndash;<em>&ndash; coding: utf-8 &ndash;</em>&ndash;</h1>

<p>while True:</p>

<pre><code>answer = raw_input('Could you please give me $100? ')
if answer.lower() in ('y', 'yes', 'ok', 'true', 'sure', 'of course', 'why not?'):
    print "Thank You!"
    break
else:
    print "We don't take «No» for an answer. Did you mean «Yes»?"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then I though, “Hey, C++ is by far a lot more powerful than Python syntax-wise, does this program really have to be that long and ugly?” Challenge accepted. A minute later, it looked even shorter than my Python version:</p>

<p>```c++
while (!in(lower(raw_input(&ldquo;Could you please give me $100? &rdquo;)),</p>

<pre><code>       "y", "yes", "ok", "true", "sure", "of course", "why not?"))
std::cout &lt;&lt; "We don't take «No» for an answer. Did you mean «Yes»?" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>std::cout &lt;&lt; &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
```</p>

<p>Well, of course this took some “magic” to work, which went to a reusable header. The complete program is a bit larger if put into a single source file:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <string></h1>

<h1>include <cctype></h1>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>static std::string raw_input(const char *prompt)
{</p>

<pre><code>std::string answer;
std::cout &lt;&lt; prompt &lt;&lt; std::flush;
std::getline(std::cin, answer);
return answer;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>static std::string &amp;&amp;lower(std::string &amp;&amp;s)
{</p>

<pre><code>for (auto &amp;c : s)
    c = std::tolower(c);
return std::forward&lt;std::string&gt;(s);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>static bool in(const std::string &amp;)
{</p>

<pre><code>return false;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>template &lt;size_t N, typename &hellip;Args>
static bool in(const std::string &amp;s, const char (&amp;arg0)[N], Args &amp;&amp; &hellip;argN)
{</p>

<pre><code>return s == arg0 || in(s, std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(argN)...);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>int main()
{</p>

<pre><code>while (!in(lower(raw_input("Could you please give me $100? ")),
           "y", "yes", "ok", "true", "sure", "of course", "why not?"))
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "We don't take «No» for an answer. Did you mean «Yes»?"
              &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; "Thank you!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_templates">Variadic templates</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion</a> can do magic (and compiler unrolls everything, I’ve checked).</p>

<p>I don’t want to start a language war or anything, but my opinion is that Python’s beauty is not in its simple or powerful syntax. Not at all.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Why C++ Member Function Pointers Are 16 Bytes Wide]]></title>
    <link href="http://741MHz.com/wide-pointers/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://741MHz.com/wide-pointers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When talking about pointers, we generally assume it is something that can be represented by <code>void*</code> pointer which has a size of 8 bytes on the x86_64 architecture. For instance, here is an excerpt from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">Wikipedia article about x86_64</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pushes and pops on the stack are always in 8-byte strides, and <strong>pointers are 8 bytes wide</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the CPU point of view, pointer is nothing but a memory address, and all memory addresses are represented by 64-bit on the x86_64, so the assumption about 8 bytes is correct. It is also not that hard to verify this by simply printing sizes of pointers of different types:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt;
    "sizeof(int*)      == " &lt;&lt; sizeof(int*) &lt;&lt; "\n"
    "sizeof(double*)   == " &lt;&lt; sizeof(double*) &lt;&lt; "\n"
    "sizeof(void(*)()) == " &lt;&lt; sizeof(void(*)()) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Compile and run the above program, and it will tell that all pointers are of size 8:</p>

<p><code>
$ uname -i
x86_64
$ g++ -Wall ./example.cc
$ ./a.out
sizeof(int*)      == 8
sizeof(double*)   == 8
sizeof(void(*)()) == 8
</code></p>

<p>In C++, however, there is one exception — pointer to a member function. Interestingly enough, the size of a pointer to a member function is twice the size of any other pointer. This can be easily verified with this simple program which would print “16”:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>struct Foo {</p>

<pre><code>void bar() const { }
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(&amp;Foo::bar) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Does this mean that Wikipedia is wrong? No, not at all. From the hardware point of view all pointers are still 8 bytes wide. So what is a pointer to a member function then? It is a feature of the C++ language, a concept that does not map directly to hardware and is being implemented in runtime (by compilers) resulting in a slight overhead that oftentimes incurs a performance penalty. The C++ language specification is not concerned with implementation details very much and there is nothing explaining this type of pointers. Luckily, there is Itanium C++ ABI specification that devotes itself to standardizing implementation details of the C++ runtime — it explains, for example, how virtual tables, RTTI and exceptions are implemented, and it also explains member pointers in §2.3:</p>

<blockquote><p>A pointer to member function is a pair as follows:</p>

<p>ptr:</p>

<p>For a non-virtual function, this field is a simple function pointer. For a virtual function, it is 1 plus the virtual table offset (in bytes) of the function, represented as a ptrdiff_t. The value zero represents a NULL pointer, independent of the adjustment field value below.</p>

<p>adj:</p>

<p>The required adjustment to this, represented as a ptrdiff_t.</p></blockquote>

<p>So a member function pointer is 16 bytes instead of 8 because along with a simple function pointer it also must store the information about how to adjust “this” pointer (something that is always passed to non-static member functions implicitly). What ABI spec does not say is why and when such an adjustment is required. It might not be that obvious at first. Let’s take a look at the following class hierarchy:</p>

<p>```c++
struct A {</p>

<pre><code>void foo() const { }
char pad0[32];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>struct B {</p>

<pre><code>void bar() const { }
char pad2[64];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>struct C : A, B
{ };
```</p>

<p>Both A and B have a non-static member functions and a data member. Both of those methods can access data member of their class through an implicitly passed “this” pointer. In order to access any data member, the offset from the base address of the class object containing it, represented as a ptrdiff_t, is applied to “this” pointer. Things start to get complicated with multiple inheritance. What happens when we have a class C inherit both A and B? The compiler would take A and B and place them together in memory, where B comes after A. Therefore, methods of class A and methods of class B would “see” a different value of “this” pointer. This can be easily verified in practice, for example:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>struct A {</p>

<pre><code>void foo() const {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "A's this: " &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
char pad0[32];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>struct B {</p>

<pre><code>void bar() const {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "B's this: " &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
char pad2[64];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>struct C : A, B
{ };</p>

<p>int main()
{</p>

<pre><code>C obj;
obj.foo();
obj.bar();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><code>
$ g++ -Wall -o test ./test.cc &amp;&amp; ./test
A's this: 0x7fff57ddfb48
B's this: 0x7fff57ddfb68
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, “this” pointer’s value passed to B’s method is greater than one passed to A’s method by 32 bytes – an exact size of class A. But what happens when we have the following function that calls a method of class C by pointer?</p>

<p>```c++
void call_by_ptr(const C &amp;obj, void (C::*mem_func)() const) {</p>

<pre><code>(obj.*mem_func)();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Depending on what method is being called, a different value of “this” must be passed. But the “call_by_ptr” function doesn’t know whether it got a pointer to “foo()” or a pointer to “bar()”. The only time when this information is available is when address of either of those methods is taken. And that’s why a pointer to a member function also has information about how to adjust “this” before calling a method. Now, let’s put all of that together into a simple program that demonstrates what is going on “under the hood”:</p>

<p>```c++</p>

<h1>include <iostream></h1>

<p>struct A {</p>

<pre><code>void foo() const {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "A's this:\t" &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
char pad0[32];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>struct B {</p>

<pre><code>void bar() const {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "B's this:\t" &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
char pad2[64];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>struct C : A, B
{ };</p>

<p>void call_by_ptr(const C &amp;obj, void (C::*mem_func)() const)
{</p>

<pre><code>void *data[2];
std::memcpy(data, &amp;mem_func, sizeof(mem_func));
std::cout &lt;&lt; "------------------------------\n"
    "Object ptr:\t" &lt;&lt; &amp;obj &lt;&lt;
    "\nFunction ptr:\t" &lt;&lt; data[0] &lt;&lt;
    "\nPointer adj:\t" &lt;&lt; data[1] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
(obj.*mem_func)();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>int main()
{</p>

<pre><code>C obj;
call_by_ptr(obj, &amp;C::foo);
call_by_ptr(obj, &amp;C::bar);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The above program prints the following:</p>

<h2>```</h2>

<p>Object ptr: 0x7fff535dfb28
Function ptr:   0x10c620cac
Pointer adj:    0</p>

<h2>A&rsquo;s this:   0x7fff535dfb28</h2>

<p>Object ptr: 0x7fff535dfb28
Function ptr:   0x10c620cfe
Pointer adj:    0x20
B&rsquo;s this:   0x7fff535dfb48
```</p>

<p>Hopefully that clears things up a little bit.</p>
